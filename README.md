# flutter_web_rtc_with_call_kit

Flutter example of webrtc with callkit for Android and iOS.

* WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a powerful framework that allows for peer-to-peer
  communication between web browsers and mobile apps, enabling features like audio and video
  calling, screen sharing, and file transfer.

* CallKit is an Apple framework designed to enable seamless integration of audio and video calling
  services into our apps. It provides a native-like calling interface, improving the user experience
  by mimicking the look and feel of the system's Phone app.

Communication.](https://medium.com/mindful-engineering/Integrating-Flutter-WebRTC-with-CallKit-for-Seamless-Communication)

# Flowchart to get a clear understanding of the entire process

1. Call Initiation: User A starts a video call with User B.
2. Signaling: A signaling server facilitates the exchange of SDP and ICE candidates between User A
   and User B to establish a connection.
3. Connection Setup: Once signaling is complete, WebRTC captures and transmits audio and video data
   between the devices of User A and User B.
4. Incoming Call Notification: User B's device receives the incoming call, and CallKit displays a
   system notification, allowing the user to accept or decline.
5. Call Handling: If User B accepts, CallKit informs the Flutter app, which then establishes the
   WebRTC-based audio and video connection between the devices.
6. In-Call Experience: The video call is displayed in the app's interface, with controls for muting
   audio or video, or ending the call.
